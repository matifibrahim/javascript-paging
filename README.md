# javascript-paging
This code was written when I was asked to write paging for one of our Laravel projects with some unique requirements.
- The 1st page must be loaded with contents from the server. So no Ajax call to server. It will save bandwidth and user will be able to see 1st page immediately. 
- The complete control over html / CSS as readily available JS components take control of few of these aspects.

So I wrote this JS to bring an html table to start working as grid, Unfortunately I lost the Laravel server side code but I have the response we receive from server and the html redndered by server.
